### The score

In tables and maps on this website, you will see that countries are assigned a score. The score is a value between 0 and 100, where a higher score means a worse performance; that is, a greater number of affected devices and a higher level of risk or infection. You can read more about the [score and how it is calculated on the about page](/about#score).
