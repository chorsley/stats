The following table lists countries scored by how well they are doing based on four different
criteria:

  * number of open recursive DNS devices (opendns)
  * number of open recursive NTP devices (openntp)
  * number of open recursive SSDP devices (openssdp)
  * number of spam messages originating from that particular country, as registered by one spam trap.

See also the [risks](/risk/) page for a detailed description.

Where there was no data, a "n/a" is shown.
Countries with two or more "n/a" colums were filtered out.

### The score

In the table below the number shown is the score for a country. This score is a value between 0 and 100, where a higher score means a worse performance; that is, a greater number of affected devices and a higher level of risk or infection. You can read more about the [score and how it is calculated here](/about#score).
